Cloud is Pay as you go model 
or Reservation model 
or Unused resources discount model 
=========================================
Scalling Type :

Horizontal Scaling 

scenario : small app which need less RAM and CPU 

1 inst -> 1 instance - 1 instance 

Vertical scalling 

More RAM and cPU 

1 instance 
Bigger instance 
Biggest instance 

and this could go horizontal instances 

idle scalling : horizontal scalling + vertical scalling if you app added some big features 

best is horizontal

PAAS : Follow Horizontal scalling 

Auto scalling give you horizontal 

Vertical scallig we remove small instacne and add bigger instance 
=====================================
Benifits of cloud : Cost saving, 24*7 Availability, scalability, Automated update of software, Desaster recovery, security, reduce carbon footprint etc.

Cloud Options:
Public cloud : provided by third party provider , simply come, use and pay eg AWS ,AZURE etc
Private cloud : For a interprises, like you personal resources , eg : private car public ola uber
Hybrid : as per requriemt some app as public some as private so based on req . eg website in public but data base in private of same application 

===================================
Type of Cloud Computing 
IAAS : Do what ever you want compute storage networking all you deside all access, only hardware is managed by Service provider. 
PAAS : like only application and data part how much hardware need how much ram how much CPU you think only till that 
SAAS : use Software what you want to do , eg gmail ready application 

same mail if you are making so it will be under PAAS.
===================================
Deployment methods :
Rolling Deployment
shading deployment 
canaery deployment 
blue green deployment : first it will create replica and new update install updated then dns will connect to this 

pod failure : too much traffic cpu memory usage so contaier will terminate or health check will fail then pod fails 

on premices means local data centers 
=========================
Basic cloud knowledge
Database  Data bakup data store 
Virtulizatin orchistartion 
API JSON 
Linux sheet

a application can run in any cloud, or it can run any where
