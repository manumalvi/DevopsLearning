Splunk/Kibana/premethos/librato etc CM tools 

Nagios : its a open source tool for COntinious monitoring for system , network and infrastructure. 
Basic use of CM is Reduce Downtime. 

Failure inside CI/CD pipeline 
Apllication Failure 
Infrastructure Failure 
Analysis of Failure 

Nagios Port number : 5666,5667 and 5668 to monitor its client.

Reduce Downtime
Client server Architecture 
Nagios Server send request to Client and ask all ok its called Active Monitoring . If client send update menas its passive Monitoring.
Detect all type of network/server and infrastructure issue.
Very oldest and still used max. 

Send alert if condition change . 
Monitoring network services like http,smtp,snmp,ftp,DNS,pop,ssh etc .

Phase of COntinious Monitoring:
1. Define : Develop a monitoring stratergy.
2. Establish : How frequently you want to monitor.
3. Impliment 
4. Analyze data nad report 
5. Respond 
6. Renew and Update

Nagios Architecture :
Its a client server . Nagios server will have configuration file which will have client ip address etc. 

SO Deamon will do all work and it has one Plugin NRPE which do work . Negios Remote plugin executor. 
but clicnt also should have some one to tell to that NRPE plugin so on client its NRPE Agent (CHeck_SSH,check_http etc all plugins are there what ever we have to check ) is there on client nodes. 

Nagios Dashboard ---> Nagios DB ---> Nagios Deamon <---> NRPE <------ SSH --> Client NRPE 

How Does it Work ? 
1. Mention all Detaisl in Configuration File. 
2. Daemon read those details what data to be collected . 
3. Daemon use NRPE plug-in to collect data from nodes and store in its Database.
4. from DB it shows on Dashboard.


PreRequisite : 
httpd
php
gcc & gd compiler 
makefile to build
perl 

Main Configuration File 
/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

All moniotring things called as Service. 

Eg: 5 serves (nodes or clinet ) --> 4  checks each  (http,ssh etc )
you have to monitor 5*4=20 services.

On Dashboard You can see : 

Host--> down
		unreachable
		up
		recovery
		none
		
Services -> warning
			unknown
			critical 
			recovery
			pending
