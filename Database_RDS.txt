No SQL is without structure to link data. It has low cost HW , Faster .
Horizonontal Autoscaling is possible . 
No fix column structure, schema free , suiable for analytical processing .
Data warehouse online analytical processing , DB is online transcation processing. 
MOngaDb , casandra , DynamoDB etc 

Type of NoSQL DB 

Column DB : it saves data in columns , eg casandra , Hbase.
Document DB : data in document form json,xml eg, MongoDB 
Key value DB : unique key value will be there primary key  eg redis DynamoDB , keeps data in cache memory and keep session also.
Graph base DB : for graph base data like maps 

==============================================

AWS  manages following things for Relational DB  : 

1. Security & pathcing 
2. Automated Backup
3. Software updates
4. If multi AZ selected then it will automaticly handle failover for standby.
5. Every DB has maintinance window. 

Managed y user

1. DB managing setting
2. DB schema 
3. DB performance 

Options of Realtion DB in AWS : 
1. My SQL server
2. My sql 
3. Oracle
4. AWS Aurora : High Throuput
5. Postgre SQL : High reliable and stable open source 
6. Maria DB 

** DB uses EBS storage only. 

==============================================

Multi AZ in RDS:

1. while creating only multi AZ can be enabled. not in free tier. 
2. you cant add standby AZ in which region you want.

Conditions for failover 
1. primary DB failed
2. AZ itself failed
3. COnnectivity network issue with primart.
4. Primary EC2 Failed
5. Storage of DB failed
6. Patching of OS done
7. rebooting of instance 

What happend in Failover : 

we do not give IP we give CNAME Cronical Name record 
CNAME is inside DNS 
CNAME is always updated to all ip .
Enadpoint is needed to access not ip 
==============================================
1. When every Failover SNS notification will go . 
2. CLI / API for 14 days you can ck failover but on console only see 1 day. 
3. ANy patching any update first will happen on Standby . if you will take on active then outage will happend of DB.
4. Snapshot or backup standy by will be used for it .
5. IMP : Backup stored in s3 
6. retention persiod means for how many days you will have bk copy. dont want backup retention put 0.
==============================================
Lab : 
Create a DB and create ec2 instance and access through it by RDS endpoint . linux CLI method 
Create a DB and install DB client and then connect this with DB now you can ck the tables of DB . DB client access. 

==============================================

DynamoDB : 

Max on internet is unstructured data. DynamoDB is for unstructured or semi structured Data. 

DynamoDB table its collection of item. Item is group of attribute. 
Attribute consist of name and value (key,value)
Aggribate size of an item is max 400 kb . if its more that 400kb then put in s3 bkt and url of s3/pointer put here. 
DynamoDB stores data index by primary key, you specify primary key when create table. 
Primary key is only reqiuired attribute in table. 
DynamoDB schema less. 

Read Capacity unit : 
Evantually Consistent : give upto ful updated value . 2rcu = 8 kb . cheap, fast
Strongly consistent :   1RCU = 4 kb  in same price of eventully. expensive , most chances of getting updated data . 

DynamoDB is for more read and less write applications. 
===========================================

DynamoDB has primary key as sring , number and binary key .
