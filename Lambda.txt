Lambda is Serverless Computing . Without any server. 

Its cheap bcoz on this when ever code will run then only it will be chargable. 

- Lambda is a compute service that let you run code without provisiongin or managing server. 

- With Lambda , you can run code for any type of application or backend service all with zero administration . 

- High avalibility and auto scaling 
- Monitoring halth
- security 
- deploying your code
- lambda function is nothing but your code
- it manage logs also 

100 mili second it bills . 

it triggers at perticular time you have to configure it .

If you want to manage your own compute then use Ec2 or Beanstalk. 

=================

Lambda 								Ec2
Lambda is PAAS .				IAAS Service 
support 7 language				Any language
rute code and push to lambda	you need to choose OS , language etc .
you can logon to OS/plat		you can 


Function is a resource that envoke to run code in lambad . that function has code . 

Event source / triger : event is a json docs 

downstream source : after triger next work will be done by lamda we give role to it. 

concurency : Numbr of request that lambda is serving 

===========================

First event will happen --> trigger will happend (trigger menas envoking lambda )-->

Eg: if in s2 bucket one obj will come (or obj change happened , this will happen via a iam role) or API http request is there then it will trigget lambda code. 

lambda function dynamodb, kinesis(streaming), lambda do pull and push both 

lambda func can trigger lambda func. 

Eg: Bucket --> one obj added --> lamda got triggerd it will also DynamoDB to do entri of that object file such as name , size etc . 

real exp : if you create gmail id --> so bck end it will triger google phoot access, g drive access etc this is automation .

you can put dependecies also in lambda function
you can change config data via api lambad provide it . 

you can run only those which work is done in max 15 min you can trigger those in labda function. default 3 sec max 15 sec. 

it is good only for small task and it cheap for less time only . 
===========================

Lambda invoke type:

synchronus    push  most common
asynchronous  event
poll based    pull 

asynchronous you can set to SNS, SQS , lambda cloudformation, 

poll based : kinosis , SQS , dynamodb


=========================

Lab Create a Role for lambda gvive full access to DynamoDB via IAM serveice 

create lambda and put code like if you add any thnig to s3 its inof go to dynamodb table 

create s3 , create dynamodb , updaload any thing in s3 trigger and destinition is dynamodb ck entries here.
