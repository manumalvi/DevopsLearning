Configuration Management tool : Ansible

Other Configuration Management tools are Chef / Puppet 

Previously System Admin do all server updates, network ck, S/W updates etc but Now its automated by theses tools like Ansible.

Difference btw Ansible and Chef 

Ansible work on Push mechanizm , if any updates will come for S/W it will push to the Nodes .
Chef work on Pull mechanizm if any notifcation came like for update it will ask . if work is there then chef will do .

Ansible uses YAML scripting : Yet another markup language, YAML work on Key-pair 

Ansible by Redhat, its version came which is drag and drop without CLI called Ansible Tower (formerly 'AWX') is a web-based solution that makes Ansible even more easy.

Open source Configuration mgmt, deployment and orchestration tool.

It can be managed by on premise and cloud. It configure IAAC .

Ansible Architecture :

Ansible Server (YAML) ----SSH->----Node1 (Host1 also called) Node2  Node3(Agent less No agant on nodes)

In Ansible where you write script Called Playbook. 

Ansible is Agent less. It communicate through ssh.

Advantage : Free, light weight, Agentless, secure ssh . YAML, push mechanism.

===============================================================================

Terms of Ansible

Ansible Server : machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbook will run.

Module : Module is a command or set of command meant to be executed on client side.

Task : Task is a section that consist of a sinlge procedure to be completed.

Role : way of organizing task and files.

Fact :

Invenrty: File contain data about the client server. /etc/ansible/hosts

play : Execution of playbook . 

Handler : Task which is called only if a notifier is present. 

Notifier : 

Playbooks: group of modules

Hosts : Node or Host are same

Ansible Practical Lab 

AWS , 3 Instance in same AZ 

1. On 1 instance which will be Ansible server , do putty and download ansible 
[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# amazon-linux-extras install epel

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# yum install ansible -y

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# yum update -y

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# yum install git python python-level python-pip ansible -y

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# ansible --version


2. Now go to host file make ansible server and paste nodes private ips. this host file also called inventry 
vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[demo]
172.31.15.118
172.31.11.132

3. Uncomment the Below in  vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

uncomment the below : 

inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo_user      = root


4. now create user/password in all 3 instance all user could be different.
#adduser ansible
#passwd ansible 

5. Give all Privilage to created user also in server and nodes (all machines).
vi visudo
root  All=All 
ansible All= All  NOPASSWD:ALL			add this line 

Switch user 
#su - ansible 

Now these user can also install any thing like httpd (sudo yum install httpd -y)

Now we need to update in ssh file to communincate both way on all machines first become su - ansible on all nodes 

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# su - ansible
Last login: Mon Apr  4 12:14:11 UTC 2022 on pts/0

6. FOr Permission denied Edit vi /etc/ssh/sshd-config   go as root user to edit on all nodes 

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ssh 172.31.15.118
The authenticity of host '172.31.15.118 (172.31.15.118)' can't be established.

Warning: Permanently added '172.31.15.118' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$

# vi /etc/ssh/sshd-config 

PermitRootLogin yes					Uncomment this 

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication yes				UNcomment this 
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
#PasswordAuthentication no				COmment this 

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# service sshd restart  $ on all nodes 

[root@ip-172-31-4-121 ec2-user]# ssh <Node1 public ip >			# Give password it will login 


7. To avoide password in all remote nodes do below Do this as ansible user 

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .ssh


this is called Trust relation ship 

it happens root bt root 
or user btw user only 

once created copy it by 

ssh-copy-id ansible@privateip 


[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 .ssh]$ ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.15.118
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
ansible@172.31.15.118's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ansible@172.31.15.118'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 .ssh]$ ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.11.132

try ssh only from master node to other nodes pasword lewass login will happen. 

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 .ssh]$ ssh 172.31.15.118				

===============================================================================

Few Ansible Command 

To ck list of nodes 

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-182 ~]$ ansible all --list-host					# It will list all the Hosts
  hosts (2):
    172.31.7.3
    172.31.2.149
	
[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible demo --list-host					# It will list all the Hosts in demo /etc/ansible/hosts inverory
  hosts (2):
    172.31.15.118
    172.31.11.132

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible demo[1] --list-host				# It will sort the second host in the demo
  hosts (1):
    172.31.11.132
[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible demo[0] --list-host				# It will sort the first host in the demo
  hosts (1):
    172.31.15.118

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible demo[-1] --list-host				# It will sort the last host in the demo
  hosts (1):
    172.31.11.132


[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible demo[1:4] --list-host				# It will sort from second to third host in the demo

[ansible@ip-172-31-4-121 ~]$ ansible <grp1>[1:4]:<grp2>[1:5] --list-host   # It will sort from 2 groups group 1 and Group 2 hosts in the demo
 
=====================

Code Can be pushed with 3 methods 

1. Ad Hoc Commands (Nothng but simple Linux Commands) Ad-hoc means Temprary, for small takss like shutdown , start , etc quick functions. One time usage
2. Modules
3. PlayBook

Adhoc : Its not having Brain It do No Idopotency it means if a file already create/exist and you give commnd via adhoc it will again create and overrite
		that y its not having brain , and this is the disadvantage.
		
Module : and PlayBook both are in YAML . Module is a single commnd 
			More than 1 module (more commands) is called Palybook . 

playbook : More than 1 module (more commands) is called Palybook. 

Module is like a page and playbook is like entire book.
================================================================

Ad-hoc : Its in /usr/bin/ansible 

Example of adhoc commands:

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -a "ls"				-a is argument for adhoc commands

[ansible@ip-172-31-10-179 ~]$ ansible nodes -a "ls"

===================================================

Ansible Modules:  Module and PlayBook has Idempotency

Ansible ships with a number of modules (called module library) that can be execute directly on remote hosts or through playbook.
Its in package itself of ansible , its not in adinal database 

its location is inverory file only. 
/etc/ansible/hosts

Example of Module Command

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"		# In yaml install=present, remove=absent, update=latest -b is sudo -m module

ansible all -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"  

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest"

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=absent"

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=raj"						to add user and if you want to remove state=absent then it will remove

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src=file1 dest=/tmp"			to copy files 

** If you suppose run httpd present command twice so in first it will install and in second it will through that its already installed, its inteligent.

Module Setup 

How this module or palybook know that this file is present already or pkg is alredy install, this happens bcoz of setup file in module so it first go to nodes and check wether file/pkg is present or not and give info to server if not present it install . 

setup keep run in background , an thats y idempoteny is possbile.

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m setup			all info of node it will give 

[ansible@ip]$ansible demo -b -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*"

===================================================

PlayBook :

Playbook is written in YAML, human readable 

Playbook is like a file where we need to write code. Playbook can have one or more modules.

Target section : Define the host against which playbook task has to be executed.

Variable section : define variable 

Task : list of all module which need to be run in an order. 

YAML

For ansible nearly every YAML file start with list.
Each item in list is having key-value pair called dictionary.

All YAML file start with "---" and end "..." (not mendroty), .yml format file
Indentation is important in yaml.

key: value
name: manu			give space after colon

hosts = On which nodes you need to run those 
user = by which user you need to do that
become = to becoe sudo 
connection = ssh previosly parameko was also there 


--------------------------------------------------
[ansible@ip]$ vi targetsection.yml

--- # my first target playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: yes

:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook targetsection.yml

-----------------------------------------------------
[ansible@ip]$ vi mytask.yml

--- # my first target and task playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
		- name: install httpd on linux
	      action: yum name=httpd state=installed

:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook mytask.yml


TO REMOVE a package 

- hosts: nodes
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd on system
      action: yum name=httpd state=removed


-----------------------------------------------------


[ansible@ip]$ vi myvariable.yml

--- # my first variable playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  
  vars:
		pkgname: httpd
  
  tasks:
		- name: install httpd on linux
	      action: yum name='{{pkgname}}' state=installed

:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook myvariable.yml

----------------------------------------------------

Handler: It same as task but it will run when called by another task.
		 But only run if a task contain "notify" in it.
		 
		 notify has som thing so in handler name also same should come then only it will know what to do and its dependent.


[ansible@ip]$ vi myhandlers.yml

--- # my first handler playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  
  tasks:
		- name: install httpd on linux
	      action: yum name=httpd state=installed
		  notify: restart httpd

  handlers: 
		- name: restart httpd
		  action: service name=httpd state=restarted

:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook myhandlers.yml



Dry run : 

its to check if your playbook is written correctly or not to chekc bfore execution .

ansible-paybook test.yml --check 

-------------------------------------------

Loops:

[ansible@ip]$ vi loops.yml

--- # my first loop playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  
  tasks:
		- name: Add a list of user
	      user: name="{{items}}" state=present			or action: user name"{{items}}" state=present
		  with_items:
		        - bhupendra
				- raj
				- manu

:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook loops.yml

---------------------------------------

Conditions: 

When ever we have different scenarios we have conditions. 

[ansible@ip]$ vi COnditions.yml

--- # my first loop playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  
  tasks:
		- name: INstall apache in Debian
	      command: apt-get -y install apache2						command is a module here 
		  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
		  
		- name: INstall apache in Redhat
	      command: yum -y install httpd
		  when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"


:wq!

[ansible@ip]$ansible-paybook Conditions.yml

----------------------------------------

Vault : Ansible playbook is not secure so value can encrypt it bcoz playbook can have passwords and keys etc . hence valut is used .
You can encripy it whilce creating only , 

Create encrypt playbook (give password  AES256 for encryption Algo)

	ansible-vault create myplaybook.yml

Edit the Encrypted palybook

	ansible-vault edit myplaybook.yml

To Chnage the password 

	ansible-vault rekey myplaybook.yml

To encrypt existing playbook 

	ansible-vault encrypt target.yml

To decrypt existing playbook 

	ansible-vault decrypt target.yml
	
----------------------------------------


Roles:

Roles are good for organize tasks , we can make saperate files for tasks, handlers etc. 

Below are few roles 

Default : used for store data of application like variable port etc 

Files: it contain file need to be transfer to remote VM 

Handlers : we can sagrigate handler 

Meta : data of data , data detils 

Tasks: all tasks in playbook 

Vars : variables 

master.xml is main file and when it will crete target and inside that roles is there so it will call those files. 

Practical 

$ mkdir -p playbook/roles/webserver/tasks

$ tree 				to see herarchy 

if you want hander also 
$ mkdir -p playbook/roles/webserver/handler

[playbook]$ touch roles/webserver/tasks/main.yml

[playbook]$ touch master.yml 

master and role should have same level. 

Now you can write any thing in main.yml 

and in vi master.yml you have to put target and Roles

--- # my first loop playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  roles: 
		- webservr
		
$ansible-paybook master.yml    so rolls will webserver and webserver will call task main.yml and so on .
