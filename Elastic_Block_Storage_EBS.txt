EBS Backed EC2 instance : OS is in EBS
Instance Store Backed EC2 instance : OS/Root volume is in Instance 

EBS is network attached virtual Drive.

Instance Store is Faster than EBS.Instance srote is limit of 10 gb but can increase.

Non Persistance : Instance Store , it will delete on stop and terminate but not on reboot.

EBS is good for database. 

1 EBS is attached to 1 EC2 in a single AZ. EBS and Ec2 should be on same AZ.

EBS will replicate in same AZ .

EBS Volume type :

SSD (Solid state drive) types its measure in IOPS
General Purpose SSD(gp2) this is default volume , Its bootable  (By default gp2 is selected) , 30 GB free . 
Provision IOPS , its also bootable . used in mission critical operations eg ISRO, satellite , AI based medical operations . 
Maganetic standard . its also bootable . Lowest cost in bootable .

IOPS : how fast input / output will happen, for more read write Input output per second (IOPS). 
Through put : MB per second how much fst data transper

HDD (Hard disk drive)  Its non bootable , we cant install OS in it ,only for extra storage. Measured in Through Put 
Types : 
Through put optimized : daily usge of data , MB per second , for big data , data warehouse . 
Cold HDD : cheapest . 

=========================================
EBS Snapshot 

EBS volume are point-in-time images/copies of your EBS volume.
EBS snapshot of EC2 volume store in S3 bucket but its your S3 bucket and even you cant see where is that S3.you can only access through EC2 API.
It may take time (based on the snapshot size )from EBS to S3 but once you initiated snapshot it will take that much only. 

Per AWS A/C 5000 EBS and 10000 Snapshot max.

**IMP : EBS volume are AZ specific , snapshot are region specific. 
	  EC2 and EBS will on in same AZ.
	  Snapshot will be in somewhere s3 for that region so that all AZ can access it . 
	  
	  Migration of EBS from 1 AZ to other AZ so make snapshot and then create EBS in other AZ. 
	  20Gb EBS ------took snapshot -----snapshot 20gb-------new EBS from Snapshot must be = 20Gb or More. 
	  
	  Non root volume is running you can take snapshot. and you can use also while snapshoting. 
	  
	  Incrimental snapshot : first time snapshot will take time next time it wont take that much time bcoz it wont copy which is already copied/present.
	  
	  to take complete snapshot of non root volume either stop or un mount. 
	  
	  
Root Volume : you can not take snapshot in running state. stop and then take snapshot. other wise error , if its Instance store volume then pause it. 

Incrimental Snapshot : EBS is AZ and snapshot is region specific. 
**IMP : 			In incrimental if there is snapshot 1 and you change some thing and again took snapshot2 and in question is if snapshot1 is deleted then it will shift snapshot1 data to snapshot2 first. 
					for less cost incrimental is good. 

===========================================

EBS Encryption : 

Encrypted Volume will create Encrypted snapshot and visa versa. 

you can attached Encrypted and un Encrypted both to Ec2. 

Encryption always happen at Ec2 side. 

No Direct way to change the Encryption state of the volume.
Method 1 : EC2 --- UnEncryped EBS1 -- Create new EBS2 and tick Encrypted --- Copy data from EBS 1 to EBS2 via EC2 so it will Encrypted.
Method 2 : Create snapshot of unencrypted volume	  


===========================================
Root Volume : 
We can encrypt root volume while creating Ec2 instance. 

workaround Method: 
make AMI of this root volume and its also unencrypted and while copying you can make encrypted . 
Encrypted AMI can be shared. 

** Snapshots are associated with EBS while AMIs are associared with EC2 instances.

==========================================
How to share EBS encryption key : 

To encrypt volume or snapshot we need a key these keys are called customer master key and managed by Key management service (KMS)
**First EBS volume encrypted aws KMS create default CMK key. you cant share key. not ebs volume.
After that each new Encrypted volume is encrypted with unique saperate AES-256 bit encryption key.

Changing Encryption key 

**Ec2----EBS key1 ---- snapshot key1 ----then create copy of Snapshot -----snapshot new key key2 now you can share this key 

UnEncryped shapshot can be shared but make it public or add account .
Encrypted snapshot cant be public on AWS , you can share without default key. 

A snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume
==========================================
Lab root volume with another EC2 Instance 
so detach current volume and attach new volume but give /dev/sda1 
 
recomanded : stop root volume while taking snapshot.
