AUthenticated : signed-in 
Authorized : Permission

from aws you can create 5000 acount. in one go 10 can be added . 
there could be 1000 roles under aws A/c.
Iam user can be member of 10 group.

IAM Feature : 
Galnuar permission : 
different permissions, like just show s3 , or ec2
IAM is free service
===============================================
IAM Terms/components:

Principal : doer , who is doing work , it could be user ,application
Request : principal will do request to do work 
Authentication: user name password
Authorization : what rights he has 
Action/operations: the work is action 
Resource : on which action is done eg s3 , ec3 are resources.

By default root user has all resource allowed and IAM user has all denyed.

if reource has policy 
deny
deny 
explicit allow it will get allows bcoz explicit allow has more waightage .

explicit dent has more waitage then explicit deny.

max 10 policy on a resource or user. 

Entity inside a service is resource like ec2 we have instances , s3 we have bucket. in s3 we have glacier, storage . 
================================================

Identitiy federation like through facebook, google, corporate account with aws. 

SAML : for corporate identity

IAM Role is very similar as IAM user. 

IAM USer could be a person or service or application.
Group is collection of user. put policy on entire group.
Group cant be nested , can create max 300 . 

IAM role doesnt not have any username/password.

===============================================
Permission are granted through policies that are created and attached to group, user or role. and its called identity based policy.

if policiy on resource its called resource based policy. 

On User we can give policy in 3 ways : 
1. Attach it to a group 
2. copy permission from existing user 
3. Attach existing policy direcly. 

INline Policy : its like grp or user policy to customize the policy. 

========================
Lab 3 : Cross account accesss : 



 


===============================================
Teams 

Network Team 
Application Team 
Wintel Team (Windows + Intel)
Unix Team 
Storage Team 
DB Team 

====================

So suppose if there are 100 members in all team and network team memeber need to ck s3 logs then we need to add policy to that user and so on . 

Authentication means log in . you have aws account and logged in via user name pwd but not able to create EC2 hence you are not authorize to do so . 

in AWS to work /by any user you need authentication and authorization both .
Authnetication you can log in but if you dont have authorization you will not be able to create ec2 / s3 etc 
you are authentication if you can log in 
Authorization happens through policies . 

its defficult to give policy to different user of diff team . so its better create group eg Network / Application / DB and add policies to it.

====================
If you wanted to connect from CLI or out side of console then you need to clikc Access key . 

Cloud security develops all these customized policiy development 

We can put user in diffrent groups like higher level mgr 

Tagging is IMP always give _ insted of space 

======================

V IMP : IAM Role 

Role is like Tempraroty access 

Policies outline what can be done (permissions), and these can be attached to roles OR users. Â· Roles must be assumed by a user or a service.

Role applies on services or user 
policiy applies on role or user. 

User can switch roles 

IAM User  ---> Permission 

IAM Role ----> Permission + trust policy 

=============================

User Role - if one user access another user account its called as cross account role . 

[AWS landing zone , control tower , organization  is very vast and senior level services aws org service ]
=============================
