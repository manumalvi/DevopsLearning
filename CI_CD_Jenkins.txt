Continious Intigration / Continious Delivery   or Deployment (depends on sitiuation)

CI/CD is a methology doing things in better way . Its automated . 

Continious Intigration = Continious Building + Continious Testing 

pipeline = Virsion ctrl -> Build -> unit test-> deployment -> Testing (Functional,Reg)->Prod deployment -> Mesuar and Validate(QA)

at each level we are getting feedback in each step so its very fast. 

Plan- code -> Version ctrl Git 
Build -> maven , gradil
Test-> selenim,junit
Deployment-> chef ansible 
Monitor->nagios

so in between all there is intigration tool called jenkins , its ci tool., Its having community suppprot and lots of plugins. Bcoz of CI bug will be fast.

CD : Continius Deployment (if cust do not know how to deploy SW then some team will go and help and train them)
Continious delivery : Sw will be delivery to Customenr .

Plugins : are like small libraries that add new ability to jenkins and provide intigration point to other tool , like git , maven , selenium.

Artifact: its code after build not the raw code. ready to use . for Archiving 

Jenkins has master slave architecture . It can do cron scheduling . 

Build : Complie , Code reivew , test , packaging .jar etc 

================================================================
Jenkines : 


local Install Git , java , maven (mvn -version) , jenkins 

to restart / stop jenkins 			admin admin123

http://localhost:8080/restart  or http://localhost:8080/stop

git clone https://github.com/manumalvi/time-tracker.git
go to time-tracker once cloned in c drive 
mvn clean package  		it will build so this is manual process 

Now try to do same from jenkins select maven and give git path and give clean package (maven do no write bcoz we have selected maven project )

Schedule Project : Click on any project -> configure -> Build trigger -> build periodicly (fix interval of time it will build automaticly)

***** (Minute , hour , days , month , week)  carefull last is week 

Better Option : Source code polling 

When ever you change in code it will trigger 
jenkines home->mymavenproject->configure->go to build trigger 

select poll SCM and make *****

try by making some changes in readme file and it will build once committed .
you will see after 1 min it will build . 

which in linux 

Get-Command git.exe | Select Definition     in wondows  on poershell 

========================================

Linked Project 

Link your project/Item  to One Job is lined to another job .

UpStream : Job A will Linekned to Job B , But here JOb A will finish work and Tell to Job B to start its job .
			in Configure you need to give post Build Action , and mention Job B . so it will start Job B . 

DownSream : This is opposite of UpStream . Mention in Job B once Job A work done you need to start . 
			in Configure you need to give Build after other projects are build . 
			
			
User Management Role based : what ever role you will give to user he wll be able to perform that only suppose you give dev or test .

Master slave : 

Master menas if any job done it create a file in c jenkins folder 

if we create slave1 and slave 2 so we need to create 2 foloder also in c drive . 

slave1 and slarve1dir is not linked to each other , so you need to have agent.jar file. 

job1 if we trigger any one can do master or slaves , so for that you need to put label we need to give to job1 and slave1 so now its linked so slave will do that work . 

Manage jenkins --> manage node --> new node create slave
