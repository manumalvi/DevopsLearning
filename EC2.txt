Elastic compute cloud : 

EC2 : Elastic Compute cloud

SG security grp : INGRESS : who can access my machine what i have in my machine.
				  EGRESS  : Who can you access is Egress
				  VPC : Virtual public cloud : Internal Intranet 
				  you can give acccess to ingree and egree at network level or ec2 level
				  
pay as you go 

most of production deployment are in linux

to check EBS volume in linux : [ec2-user ~]$ lsblk 

linux package mgr is yum , apt-get 

for download in linux its wget , curl 

==============================================
Ec2 has 2 storage EBS , Instance store (Fast)
EC2 Limit : 20 Instances Per Region , above this you need to request . With 2 default high I/O instances.

Types of Ec2 Instances : Total 7 
General Purpose :	Balanced memory and CPU   M series (Large , M5 has largest RAM ), A series (Medum ,large instances) , T series  (nano , micro , medium large )
					Balance of all memory,network and compute. 
					T2/T3 used for webserver , repository 
					
Compute Optimize: 	More CPU ( C series C4 ,c5 ,c5n )  for high performence processor. Batch Procesing , Gaming , video encoding , High Performance Webser

Memory Optimize:	More RAM (R , X , Z series), used for large Data sets , data , sql/no sql data both More RAM 16-768 GB ram size 

Accelerated computing / GPU : Graphics optimisez  (P , G ,F series) used in Live string , fb , youtube , 3d gamies etc , ML , AI , Deep learning , 								Graphics intensive 

Storage Optimize : Low latancy  (D < I <H series ) sequential read and write access eg songs.pk , music sites , video sites 

High memory Optimize: High Ram Nitro System (Specilized hyperviser) Dedicated Host for 3 yrs no virtualization in this . No Hiperviser in this . Bare metal means direct OS install on hard ware .   biggest memory 12 TB ram 
=============================================
EC2 Purchasing options : 
On Demand Instanace		: our t2 are instace on demand instances 
Dedicated Instanace
Spot Instanace												cheepest instance 
Dedicated Host 
Schedule Instanace		Time Fix 4 hrs daily 
Reserved Instanace 	1 to 3 year reserve						cheper instance 

=============================================

Ec2 Access : 

1. You need a key and pair name
2. you can download private key only once and public key saved by AWS 
3. Every 1 min EC2 ck instance pending , running every 5 min it send data to cloud watch 
4. You can enable 1 min monitoring but uts chargable 
5. If Ec2 stopped no changes but if EBS attached then it will charge. 
IMP (EBS backed Ec2 instance means Root volume is EBS OS in EBS and if Instance store backed Ec2 OS in Instanace)


When you stop EBS backed Ec2 : 
1. Instanace perform a shutdown. running -> stop 
2. EBS will remain attached . EBS is network attached storage 
3. Instance retain its private ip and release public IP 
4. Instance retain Elastic IP 


EC2 Termination 
1. running->shutting down->Terminated
2. By default EBS root volume are deleted automaticly when ec2 are terminated.
3. If you dont want to delete you can uncheck Delete on Termination
4. Ec2 Termination Protection we can enable if its very imp. 

Ec2 Meta data 
Instace data that you can manage Eg : ip address , DNS ,AMI , instace ID , host name , public key , SG 
Metadata is not encrypted 
if you want to see your instance meta data http://169.154.169.154/latest/metadata/

Instance User data 
Data supplied by user at instance launch in form of script during launch instance. 
its limited to 16k
you can change User data by stopping ec2 first. 
UD is not encrypted. 

EBS Elastic Block Storage 
EBS you can take snapshot and move it in AZ. 
**EBS attached when instance launch when Ec2 terminated its deleted 
**Running Instance if EBS atachend then it wont delete on termination. 
At the time of Creating Instance in Add Storage you can add Volume. 
Once EBS is created you have to first attach it to some Instance , now go to Windows server and make it Bring online . 

Instance Storage 
Data not lost when rebooted instnace 
you cant detach attach this 
Instanace is stop or terminated data lost 

===================================
Lab : 
Ec2->Windows server->install IIS -> make any index.html in wwwroot and now access from public ip .

Lab: create ec2 instance and login by putty and check metadata by command
